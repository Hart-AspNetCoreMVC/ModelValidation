1.start with HomeControllers.


SETTING DEFAULT VALIDATION ERROR MESSAGES -- see startup.cs
+ validations made by model binding process. Usually returns errors that are vague and not very helpful, but can be changed. 
EX - if a date is not filled in, you will get a "The value '' is invalid" --> can be improved by adding MvcOptions, see startup.cs, see all
the options available at "ModelBingMessageProvider." object.

DISPLAYING PROPERTY LEVEL VALIDATION MESSAGES -- see MakeBooking.cshtml
+for errors to disply under input fields, use span tag with asp-validation-for attribute

MODEL-LEVEL MESSAGES --see MakeBooking.cshtml
+ set the asp-validation-summary in <div> to ModelOnly, only Model level errors will be included at top of view. Useful when using propery level error messages via <span>
+ but still will show modellevel messages, meaning errors that use a combonation of fiels for validation

SETTING VALIDATION VIA ATTRIBUTES -- see AttributeController, AttributeAppointment Model and Attribute views
+ start with directive System.ComponentModel.DataAnnotation
+ 3 Steps: 1.Attributes are added to model properties or to the class if an attribute is required for all the properties. 2. add conditional if(ModelState.IsValid) in action
  3. add div asp-validation-summary or span with asp-validation-for="property" to html desired place in html, @addTagHelper *, Microsoft.AspNetCore.Mvc.TagHelpers is required
+ attribute options: [Compare("OtherProperty")], [Range(lo,hi)], [RegularExpression("pattern")], [Required], StringLength(MinimumLength or MaxLength)]
+ all allow custom error message to be added as a parameter; ErrorMessage = "msg"
+ required bools: for single checkbox use [Range(typeof(bool), "true", "true", ErrorMessage="msg")],  for radio button(yes/no) allow null values to property and
  and check that selection was made; (bool?) and check if null.


CREATING CUSTOM PROPERTY VALIDATION ATTRIBUTE
+ create a class that derived from Attribute and implements the IModelValidator interface
